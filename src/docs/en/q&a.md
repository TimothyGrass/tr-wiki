## What are the supported versions?
- 1.16.40.02
- 1.16.201
- 1.16.210
## Why don't we support win10 version but BDS?
It is because the creator is not professional on win32, which is not confident on hooking UWP. Moreover, BDS is very suitable for multiplayer and there are hook tools available in the internet.

## Can we run this on mobile?
For mobile devices, we are unable local host trapdoor BDS, but you can run or join a Trapdoor BDS server run at cloud server or your PC
## What if i don't understand the tutorial?
Excuse me? What?
## Why not supporting all versions?
There are differences among different versions and Mojang may change its data structure in the newest version. It will be a large work load to support all versions. Also version switching tools for MCBE is recommended.
# Application
## Server crashing after code injected
1. Try injecting with administrator
2. Check if the version on trapdoor is same as the BDS version
3. Suggest issue at Github
## Shows "command not enabled" while running commands
Please check if `traodoor-config` is set up correctly. If it is failed to load, warning will be displayed on the BDS software.
## Why are some particles being weird after 1.16.40
This is because Mojang changes its rendering engine, causing error on particles rendering, not actually problem of developers.
